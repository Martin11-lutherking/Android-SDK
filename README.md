## Building

To build the library jar

```
./gradlew library:coreLibJar
```

will produce a jar in `library/build/libs` that can be added as a dependency to any android project.

**NOTE** to be able to build the project you'll need to place a file `local.properties` inside the root of the project containing.

```
sdk.dir=<your android sdk path>
```
this file is autogenerated when importing the project in android studio.

Make sure to have the latest build tools and sdk installed and updated. Currently the library is built with compileSdkVersion 21 and tools 21.1.2.
